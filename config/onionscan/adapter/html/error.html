        <h1>This is a SOCKs proxy, not an HTTP proxy.</h1>
        <p>
            It appears you have configured your web browser to use this Tor port
            as an HTTP proxy.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is not correct: This port is configured as a SOCKS proxy, not
            an HTTP proxy. If you need an HTTP proxy tunnel, use the
            HTTPTunnelPort configuration option in place of, or in addition to,
            SOCKSPort. Please configure your client accordingly.
