# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As this project has limited support, we kindly ask that you update to the latest version whenever possible.
If a security fix for an older version is absolutely necessary, this can be done on special request.
As this project doesn't yet use tags or releases for versioning, please submit the commit hash in this case.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please [create a security advisory][report] on GitHub.
As this project hasn't yet received wide recognition or adoptance,
and as the repository owner has numerous other projects simultaneously being built,
discussion and patching can be expected to begin as late as 1-2 weeks
following the initial advisory report. Ideally, a response should come within
a day or two. If your vulnerability is accepted, but a fix is outside of your skillset
and ours, for transparency, we may publicly publish the advisory.

If you have any questions regarding our conduct, feel free to open an issue.
